**Estica**, officially [The Kingdom of Estica](https://www.nationstates.net/nation=estica), is a nation located in the central area of [the Almersen Union](https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_almersen_union). It is comprised of 6 counties and 2 archipelagoes. It shares land borders with [Senerean](https://www.nationstates.net/nation=senerean) to its north and has maritime borders with [Genadie](https://www.nationstates.net/nation=genadie) and [Wilhelma and the Flanfairs](https://www.nationstates.net/nation=wilhelma_and_the_flanfairs). The national capital of Estica is Althea, and its most populous city and financial center is Backlund City.

The History of the Kingdom of Estica encompasses distinct epochs, beginning with the Grand Solomon Empire under the Antigonous Family's reign, extending its cultural and territorial influence across the Almersen region. Internal strife culminated in the War of the Four Emperors, fracturing the empire and paving the way for the Tudor Empire, which retreated to Estica, fostering exploration and cultural resurgence. Following the Tudor Empire's decline, the Early Estican Kingdom emerged, guided by the three main religions: the Church of the Evernight Goddess, the Church of the Lord of Storms, and the Church of the God of Technology, each shaping the kingdom's fabric. This era witnessed a distinctive fusion of faith and governance, while the Modern Estican Kingdom, retaining the three main religions, sees citizens aligning with the Orthodoxy of the Evernight Goddess, the Orthodoxy of the Lord of Storms, and the Orthodoxy of the God of Technology, an emblem of the nation's ongoing evolution as a constitutional monarchy, marked by resilience, adaptation, and cultural preservation.

The government structure and politics of the Kingdom of Estica are characterized by a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy. This governance system encompasses a delicate balance of power, where the reigning monarch shares authority with an elected parliamentary body. The nation's political landscape is notably influenced by a network of powerful aristocratic families, which not only hold significant positions within the government but also maintain a close relationship with the royal family, shaping the course of policy-making and administration.

Central to Estica's socio-political fabric are the three orthodox churches: the Church of the Evernight Goddess, the Church of the Lord of Storms, and the Church of the God of Technology. These ecclesiastical institutions hold sway over both spiritual and temporal matters, working in tandem with the government and military. This unique interplay between religion and governance adds a distinct dimension to the Kingdom's politics, impacting decisions and policies through the lens of faith. This dynamic underscores the multifaceted nature of Estican governance, where both secular and spiritual forces coalesce to shape the nation's direction and cultural identity.

**Etymology**

The term "Estica" originated from an ancient goddess who once ruled over the mythical Nation of Evernight. Due to the deeply ingrained tradition of revering the night sky and stars, the citizens of the Estica Kingdom chose "Her" name for their nation. The word itself also stems from an old language called "Jotun," dating back to 500 AD.
