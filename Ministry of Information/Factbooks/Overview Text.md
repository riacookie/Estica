[size=200][font=georgia]Kingdom of Estica[/font][/size]
[hr]
[b]Estica[/b], officially [nation=long+noflag]estica[/nation], is a nation located in the central area of [region=the Almersen Union]. It is comprised of 6 counties and 2 archipelagoes. It is geographically positioned with [nation=noflag]senerean[/nation] to the north and [nation=noflag]wilhelma_and_the_flanfairs[/nation] to the south, sharing land borders with both. Additionally, it has maritime boundaries with [nation=noflag]yulovian_hydrus[/nation] to its south. The national capital of Estica is Althea, and its most populous city and financial center is Backlund City.

The origin of the modern Estican Kingdom can be traced back to the Grand Solomon Empire, which was ruled by the powerful Black Emperor Solomon. This vast empire eventually split into four separate empires, leading to a conflict known as the War of the Four Emperors. After the war, one of these empires, the Tudo Empire, retreated to the South Region, which is now recognized as the present-day Estican Kingdom. As time went on, the influence of the declining Tudo Empire diminished, allowing the early Estican Kingdom to emerge. The formation of this nascent kingdom was greatly influenced by three main religions: the Church of the Evernight Goddess, the Church of the Lord of Storms, and the Church of the God of Technology. These religious institutions played a significant role in shaping the cultural and social norms of the early Estican Kingdom.

The government structure and politics of the Kingdom of Estica are characterized by a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy. This governance system encompasses a delicate balance of power, where the reigning monarch shares authority with an elected parliamentary body. The nation's political landscape is notably influenced by a network of powerful aristocratic families, which not only hold significant positions within the government but also maintain a close relationship with the royal family, shaping the course of policy-making and administration.

Central to Estica's socio-political fabric are the three orthodox churches: the Church of the Evernight Goddess, the Church of the Lord of Storms, and the Church of the God of Technology. These ecclesiastical institutions hold sway over both spiritual and temporal matters, working in tandem with the government and military. This unique interplay between religion and governance adds a distinct dimension to the Kingdom's politics, impacting decisions and policies through the lens of faith. This dynamic underscores the multifaceted nature of Estican governance, where both secular and spiritual forces coalesce to shape the nation's direction and cultural identity.

[b][u][size=150][anchor=Ety]Etymology[/anchor][/b][/u][/size]

The term "Estica" originated from an ancient goddess who once ruled over the mythical Nation of Evernight. Due to the deeply ingrained tradition of revering the night sky and stars, the citizens of the Estica Kingdom chose "Her" name for their nation. The word itself also stems from an old language called "Jotun" meaning "dark night", dating back to 500 AD.
