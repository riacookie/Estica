**Grade:** 0

**Codename:** 0-00

**Name:** "The Narrator"

**Sealing Procedures:** 0-00 is to be kept in a locked metal box sealed behind the Chanis Gate in the Holy Cathedral. The box should be tainted with Chanis Gate's aura at all time to prevent 0-00 from establishing a connection to the outside. The box should also contain several blank sheets of paper and a bottle of black ink. No personnel are allowed to access 0-00 without the permission of at least one current appointed Archbishop.

**Description:** 0-00 is a black feather quill that appears to be made of crow feathers. The quill has a silver tip that can be dipped in any liquid and used as a writing instrument. The quill does not require any external force to write, as it can stand up on its own and move across the paper. The quill is capable of writing in any language, style, and genre, depending on its mood and surroundings.

0-00's main anomalous property is that it writes about the lives of various individuals, both real and fictional, using a third-person perspective. The quill seems to have access to the memories, thoughts, and emotions of its subjects, as well as historical and factual information about them. The quill's writing is usually coherent and engaging, although it sometimes deviates from reality or adds fictional elements to its stories.

The quill's choice of subjects is seemingly random, as it can write about anyone from any time period, except the future. However, the quill shows a preference for writing about people who are near it or have interacted with it in some way. The quill will often write about the personal lives, secrets, or opinions of the church personnel who have handled or observed it, sometimes revealing sensitive or classified information. The quill will also write about other Sealed Artifacts or anomalous phenomena that it has encountered or learned about.

The quill's writing can have various effects on the readers, depending on the content and tone of the stories. Some readers may experience emotional reactions, such as laughter, sadness, anger, or fear, while reading the quill's stories. Some readers may also develop a sense of empathy or connection with the subjects of the stories, or gain new insights or perspectives on them. In rare cases, some readers may experience anomalous phenomena related to the stories, such as hallucinations, memory alterations, or reality shifts.

0-00 was found in a library in Tiir, Estica, after a civilian reported hearing weird noises coming from a storage room. A police officer was dispatched to investigate the source of the sound. He discovered 0-00 among some books and papers in the room and realized its anomalous nature when he saw a paper that described his morning activities in details.

After reporting to his department, the officerâ€™s case was handed over to the Nighthawks. They searched the library and found many books and papers that told the stories and histories of various people. All of them were authored by 0-00, who also wrote a paper about the officer who investigated the noise.

0-00 was later sent to the Holy See for sealing.
