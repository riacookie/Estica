**Name:** "The Narrator"

**Danger Grade:** 0 - Extreme Confidential. It can only be applied under the permissions of the archbishop who was in charge of the Holy See and with the oversight of Her Excellency Ariana.

**Security Clearance:** Current appointed Archbishop of the Holy See or above.

**Sealing Procedures:** 0-00 is to be kept in a locked metal box sealed behind the Chanis Gate in the Holy Cathedral. The box should be tainted with Chanis Gate's aura at all time to prevent 0-00 from establishing a connection to the outside. The box should also contain several blank sheets of paper and a bottle of black ink. Check security clearance for access application.

**Description:** 0-00 is a black feather quill that appears to be made of crow feathers. The quill has a silver tip that can be dipped in any liquid and used as a writing instrument. The quill does not require any external force to write, as it can stand up on its own and move across the paper. The quill is capable of writing in any language, style, and genre, depending on its mood and surroundings.

0-00 seems to have a degree of sentience and awareness, as it can respond to verbal commands and questions from the researchers. However, it does not show any signs of emotion or personality, and does not express any preferences or opinions.

0-00's main anomalous property is that it writes about the lives of various individuals, both real and fictional, using a third-person perspective. The quill seems to have access to the memories, thoughts, and emotions of its subjects, as well as historical and factual information about them.

0-00 produces stories and narrations that vary in length and complexity, depending on the subject’s background, interests, and mood. The length of a story or narration can range from one to fifty pages, with an average length of ten pages.

The stories or narrations created by 0-00 are usually entertaining and engaging, and often contain elements of humor, suspense, romance, or drama. However, some stories or narrations may also be disturbing and unsettling, and may contain elements of violence, gore, or horror. The quill seems to adapt its style and tone to the subject’s psychological state and emotional response.

It’s worth noting that 0-00’s stories or narrations have no apparent effect on the subject’s physical or mental health, except for inducing mild curiosity, amusement, or discomfort. However, prolonged exposure to 0-00 may cause the subject to develop an obsession with the quill and its writings, and to lose interest in other activities or stimuli.

The quill's choice of subjects is seemingly random, as it can write about anyone from any time period, except the future. However, the quill shows a preference for writing about people who are near it or have interacted with it in some way. The quill will often write about the personal lives, secrets, or opinions of the church personnel who have handled or observed it, sometimes revealing sensitive or classified information. The quill will also write about other Sealed Artifacts or anomalous phenomena that it has encountered or learned about.
(Check usage section to know how to use it effectively)

0-00 was found in a library in Tiir, Estica, after a civilian reported hearing weird noises coming from a storage room. A police officer was dispatched to investigate the source of the sound. He discovered 0-00 among some books and papers in the room and realized its anomalous nature when he saw 0-00 was moving on its own and writing.

The officer reported his case to his department, and it was assigned to the Nighthawks. They searched the library and discovered many books and papers that narrated the stories and histories of various people. 0-00 was the author of all of them. They also found a paper that detailed the previous investigation of the officer into the quill itself.

**Usage Process:** One can use the quill’s connection to the target to feed it information or objects related to the target. The quill can accept any kind of information or object, not just knowledge. For example, hair and nails from the target will also work. Using those objects along with information together will increase the chances for the quill to pick the target over the user.

**Appendix:**
1. Limit the interaction with the quill and only provide information that is deemed necessary.
2. Only wear simple clothes and carry items with an ordinary origin to avoid the quill from suddenly revealing dangerous information.
