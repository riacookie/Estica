##### Description:

The Economic Collapse that occurred on October 21st, 2022 caused a major economic shift in policies for the Kingdom of Estica, resulting in a transition from a democratic to a socialist economy. This led to a significant drop in the overall economy of the kingdom, affecting both the higher-class and lower-class citizens.

The truth behind this sudden transition in policies was not actually due to any economic factors, but rather because of the sudden appearance of an ancient evil existence. 

##### Incident details:

At exactly 13:00 on Friday, a group of cultists were found setting up an altar in an abandoned warehouse on the west side of Oak Harbor. A Machinery Hivemind squad was responsible for tailing the cultist group; they were hiding in nearby buildings, waiting for the ritual to reach a crucial point before launching a surprise attack. However, for some unknown reason, the captain of the Machinery Hivemind squad, Steve, had miscalculated the time.

In the report, the captain stated that he waited for 3 minutes before signaling the attack, but the video footage found in surveillance cameras near the scene showed that Steve and his squad were standing motionless for more than 10 minutes. This delay had given enough time for the cultists to succeed in their summoning. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the watches and phones of the Machinery Hivemind squad members were unsynchronized with the current time and were actually ticking slower. Further examination revealed that everything within a 5-kilometer radius surrounding the scene had also experienced something similar. The time in the area was being "distorted" and "expanded," leading to a slower passage of time. The operation of the Machinery Hivemind squad could very well have been leaked, and someone might have been targeting them prior to the attack in an attempt to jeopardize the effort into stopping the summoning.

Public surveillance cameras surrounding the scene picked up instances of flesh blobs and disfigured humanoid creatures walking around the street. It has been confirmed that this was due to the corrupting effect brought about by the ritual. Any electronic devices were later cut off and became contaminated by the corruptive force after 5 minutes of the ritual.

The anomaly was initially reported to the police and subsequently relayed to three local churches. They in turn deployed multiple teams of Beyonders with the objective of cordoning off the affected area. The dispatched teams are as follows:

- 1 Nighthawks team comprising 5 individuals.
- 1 Machinery Hivemind team consisting of 6 individuals.
- A team from the Paranormal Incident Unit comprising 5 individuals.

The roster of activated Sealed Artifacts employed to secure the perimeter includes:

- Sealed Artifact 2-34
- Sealed Artifact 1-07

At 13:35 in the afternoon, the combined task force arrived and swiftly initiated their respective protocols. The Nighthawks Team cordoned off a one-kilometer radius, effectively isolating the affected area from the general populace. The Machinery Hivemind Team commenced countermeasures against the malevolent entity, while the Paranormal Incident Unit Team initiated their investigation into the source and effects of the corruption.
